- separation of concerns 
- controllers handle interaction with session objects and their attributes. Session objects are never propagated
- frontend layer only consumes and produces data transfer objects (dto)
- only services interact with the model classes and the repository 
- JWT-Token for user authentication + session cookie for saving the UserQuizState (currently not persisted)
